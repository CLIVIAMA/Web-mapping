My map intends to show the viewer the biggest 100 libraries in the USA.  I use the world layer and the generated geojson data of last lab. When zoom level is smaller than 3,  the library is shown as red point and the name is beside the point. When zoom level is bigger than 3,  I use the point-file 
attribute to show the library image icon instead of point, which makes the view more meaningful.
And the label uses font Arial Bold and color #036 which makes easily read.
